              Our place is a private, affordable stand-alon guest house
              centrally located just minutes to French Quarter, downtown,the
              Fair Grounds(Jazz Fest) and City Park. The guest house is a
              quaint, 400 square ft, with a full bath, mini kitchen, & living
              room. The extra high cellings make the home feel more spacious.
              The sofa converts to a bed also. We have a hand made counte area
              that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck to relax on
              and have a glass of Merlot

                    Fantastic place. It was clea, Adrienne was a great (even
                    though we did not meet in perso) and everything went super
                    smooth. Location is also great if you like running and
                    something a bit more quiet. I would suggest a car or take
                    into consideration that you migth have to Uber into the city
                    from the location. Overall, would recommend the place
                    anytime.
